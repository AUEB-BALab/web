phd_title: Energy and Run-Time Performance Practices in Software Engineering

phd_summary: Energy efficiency for computer systems is an ever-growing matter that has caught the attention of the software engineering community. Although hardware design and utilization are undoubtedly key factors affecting energy consumption, there is solid evidence that software design can also significantly alter the energy consumption of IT products. In this thesis, we investigate the energy and run-time performance implications of various programming languages and remote Inter-Process Communication technologies in order to suggest which to use for specific cases. Moreover, through our investigation, we find that security mechanisms can affect real-world applications (i.e., Apache, Nginx, Redis, Memcached) energy and run-time performance up to 20%.
