We introduce Fuzzol, the first syntax-aware mutation fuzzer
for systematically testing the security and reliability of solc, the standard Solidity compiler.
Fuzzol addresses a challenge of existing fuzzers
when dealing with structured inputs: the generation of inputs that get
past the parser checks of the system under test.
To do so, Fuzzol introduces a novel syntax-aware mutation that breaks into three strategies,
each of them making different kind of changes in the inputs.
Moreover, to explore new paths in the compilerâ€™s codebase faster,
we introduce a mutation strategy prioritization algorithm that allows Fuzzol to identify and apply only
those mutation strategies that are most effective in exercising new inter-
esting paths. To evaluate Fuzzol, we test 33 of the latest solc stable re-
leases, and compare fuzzol with (1) Superion, a grammar-aware fuzzer,
(2) AFL-compiler-fuzzer, a text-mutation fuzzer and (3) two grammar-blind
fuzzers with advanced test input generation schedules: AFLFast
and MOpt-AFL. fuzzol identified 19 bugs in total (7 of which were previously
unknown to Solidity developers), while the other fuzzers missed
half of these bugs.

This work has been accepted at ESORICS '23 and will be presented in September 2023.
