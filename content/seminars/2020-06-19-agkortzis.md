Abstract: This short presentation is a compilation of the tasks and activities completed during the COVID-19 quarantine time. The first part of the quarantine was dedicated to finalizing and submitting the revised paper, titled Software Reuse Cuts Both Ways, to JSS. The second part was dedicated to the Real Estate Analytics EU-funded program. Specifically, we finalized a data warehouse schema, consisting of > 300 tables (facts and dimensions), and begun its population. During both quarantine parts, teaching was an always-on task and required a great effort, with the participation being the largest of the last four years.
