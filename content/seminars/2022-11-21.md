## Abstract

Sustained
exponential advances in computing power,
drops in associated costs, and
Open Science initiatives
allow us to process on a personal computer the metadata from
most major international academic publishers
as well as corresponding author, funder, and journal details.
Alexandria3k is an open-source software library and command-line tool
that builds on this capability
to allow the conduct of
sophisticated
bibliometric and scientometric studies as well as
systematic literature reviews
in an
transparent,
repeatable,
reproducible, and
efficient
manner.
In total the Alexandria3k system provides relational access to
1.5 PB of data comprising
134 million publication records,
of which 60 million contain full citation data,
15 million author records,
109 thousand journal records, and
32 thousand research funding bodies.
The system allows the execution of simple ad hoc queries over the
publication dataset or the selective population of a database for
running more complex relational queries.
Application examples include
the independently verifiable calculation of
bibliometric figures, such as the journal impact factor and the h-index,
the creation of detailed research data subsets based on the
publication topic, funder, institution, publication outlet, or author country,
and the study of the publication citation graph.
