High cohesion is a desired property of object-oriented abstractions.
LCOM is a metric that has been used traditionally to measure the degree
of lack of cohesion among methods. Software engineering community has
proposed many variants of this metric. However, these variants exhibit
deficiencies to correctly represent the degree of lack of cohesion in
certain cases. In this presentation, I would like to highlight these
deficiencies and propose a new method to compute LCOM.
