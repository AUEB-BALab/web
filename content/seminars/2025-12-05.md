This presentation examines the impact and evolution of software engineering research through four interconnected studies. First, an investigation of data papers in the Mining Software Repositories conference confirms their significant value as research artifacts while identifying opportunities for improved documentation and broader topic coverage. Second, the practical impact of software engineering research is assessed through a patent analysis and author survey, demonstrating that researchers successfully equip practitioners with tools and methods, though adoption is often hindered by funding and cost-benefit challenges. Third, a comprehensive tertiary study analyzes machine learning applications in software engineering, revealing widespread adoption across tasks but significant gaps in empirical validation and industrial transfer. Finally, the work explores Large Language Models in code completion, analyzing code perplexity to understand model confidence across different programming languages. Together, these contributions offer a holistic view of how academic research translates into practice and how emerging technologies are shaping the future of software engineering.
