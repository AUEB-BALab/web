From 2019 and onwards, the Greek National Infrastructures for Research
and Technology (GRNET) is responsible for the development, operation and
maintenance of several governmental services, thus playing an important
role in Greece's digital transformation. To address the different
challenges related to this role, GRNET teams developed AppStack,
a cloud-native platform for running gov.gr horizontal services such
as the gov.gr portal, the electronic issuance of documents signed by
the Greek state, and gov wallet among others. AppStack comes with an
enabling environment for integrating open-source software components. By
taking advantage of this feature, DevOps can incorporate suitable tools
to tackle scalability and security issues. Currently, AppStack hosts
workloads that serve more than 8 million Greek citizens, are able to
handle more than 20K requests per second, and can generate hundreds of
digital documents signed by the Greek state per second. In this talk we
will present AppStack and highlight the significance of its different
components through a number of use cases. Finally, we will describe some
key experiences from production.
