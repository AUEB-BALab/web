title: Semantic Source Code Models Using Identifier Embeddings presenter: Vasiliki Efstathiou date: 2019-04-05 category: seminars

The emergence of online open source repositories
in the recent years has led to an explosion in the volume of
openly available source code, coupled with metadata that relate
to a variety of software development activities. As an effect, in
line with recent advances in machine learning research, software
maintenance activities are switching from symbolic formal methods
to data–driven methods. In this context, the rich semantics
hidden in source code identifiers provide opportunities for building
semantic representations of code which can assist tasks of
code search and reuse. To this end, we deliver in the form of
pretrained vector space models, distributed code representations
for six popular programming languages, namely, Java, Python,
PHP, C, C++, and C#. The models are produced using fastText, a
state–of–the–art library for learning word representations. Each
model is trained on data from a single programming language;
the code mined for producing all models amounts to over 13.000
repositories. We indicate dissimilarities between natural language
and source code, as well as variations in coding conventions in
between the different programming languages we processed. We
describe how these heterogeneities guided the data preprocessing
decisions we took and the selection of the training parameters in
the released models. Finally, we propose potential applications of
the models and discuss limitations of the models.
