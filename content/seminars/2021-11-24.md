The term cloud computing firstly appeared in 1996 but it wasn't until 2006 when the first service was made available that was capable of giving access to remote virtual machines -via the internet- that could perform computations without needing to procure a physical server. Things have evolved significantly since then and many Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) have emerged, allowing organizations of all sizes and types, including academic institutions, to leverage the cloud for powering their IT workloads. In this talk, we will be exploring some of the offerings of AWS, the cloud services arm of Amazon, that could be of interest to researchers, especially around the areas of Serverless computing and Machine Learning.
