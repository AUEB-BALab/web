Software change impact analysis (CIA) methods enable
developers to understand potential impacts of a code change so that the
change can be executed confidently without affecting reliability of the
software. However, existing CIA approaches do not support CIA for all
source code granularities. Additionally, they lack support for
inter-granular change impact queries and hidden dependencies. In this
presentation, I introduce Augur, an automated static code analysis-based
CIA approach that addresses these shortcomings. Augur infers and
maintains semantic and environment dependencies along with data and
control dependencies between source code entities across granularities.
Additionally, Augur uses Change Impact Query Language, a novel query
language for impact analysis proposed in this paper, to support
inter-granular CIA queries with batch querying feature.
