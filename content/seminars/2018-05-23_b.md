Examining the different characteristics of open-source software 
in relation to security vulnerabilities, 
can provide the research community 
with findings that can lead 
to the development of more secure systems. 
We present a dataset where the reported vulnerabilities 
of 8694 open-source project versions, 
can be correlated with the corresponding source code 
and a number of software metrics.
The metrics were obtained by analyzing the project's 
source code via well-established tools. 
Apart from commonly used metrics (e.g. loc), 
we also provide data related to modern development trends 
such as continuous integration and testing. 
We outline motivational examples based on the dataset we describe.
