Shell scripts are critical infrastructure, for developers, administrators, and scientists, 
and therefore deserve the full suite of advances in compiler optimizations. 
We propose executing scripts out-of-order 
to better utilize the underlying computational resources. 
Optimizing any part of an arbitrary shell script is very challenging: 
the shell language’s complex, 
late-bound semantics makes extensive use of opaque external commands. 
We address these challenges by meeting dynamism with dynamism: 
we optimize at runtime, 
speculatively executing commands in an isolated and monitored environment 
to determine and contain their behavior. 
Our proposed approach can yield serious performance benefits 
(up to 3.9× for a bioinformatics script on a 16-core machine) 
for arbitrarily complex scripts without modifying their behavior. 
Contained out-of-order execution obviates the need for command specifications, 
operates on external commands, 
and yields a much more general framework for the improving the shell.
