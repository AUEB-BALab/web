My team investigates two types of problems, aiming first, to support
software developers in their activities, and second, to design and
develop software platforms to address specific service-delivery
challenges in domains such as healthcare and education. In this seminar,
I will report on three ongoing projects best exemplifying these two
objectives. In the context of the SAVI project, we have been designing
methods for supporting the migration of traditional relational web-based
application to the cloud, in order to enable large-scale analytics. In
the context of the LRA project, we are examining the use of linked-data
formalisms to enable large-scale REST service federation. Finally, in
the Smart-Condo project we are developing a hardware-software platform
for unobtrusively recognizing the activities of people at home, in order
to support the evaluation of their physical and cognitive function. We
believe that the broad scope of our research agenda enriches the
formulation of the technical problems we address and enhances the
validity of our results.
