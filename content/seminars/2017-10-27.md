Many studies have explored the characteristics of code smells and
analyzed their effects on the software's quality. I would like to
present our empirical study on smells that examines inter-category and
intra-category correlation between design and implementation smells. The
study mines 19 design smells and 11 implementation smells in 1988 C#
repositories containing more than 49 million lines of code and presents
our observations based on the collected data.
