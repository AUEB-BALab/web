Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) based on Machine Learning (ML)
techniques are essential for cybersecurity, utilizing datasets to
detect and mitigate malicious network or system activities.
The efficacy of IDSs is contingent on datasets that are both
extensive and representative of actual cyber threats, ensuring accurate
and robust system performance evaluation. This paper reports on a
systematic literature review (SLR) that examines the landscape of
datasets for IDS training and evaluation. The SLR explores the traits,
creation methods, and constraints of these datasets, alongside the
identification of challenges in their generation and utility. Highlighted
is the variance in dataset quality, the gradual pace of development,
and the ongoing deficit of datasets in the intrusion detection domain.
With the continuous evolution of cyber threats, a persistent reassessment
of these datasets is imperative for maintaining their pertinence and
efficacy. Our SLR aggregates and dissects the extant research to elucidate
the strengths and weaknesses of current datasets, determining their aptness
for varied IDS contexts. The objective is to delineate the present state of
IDS datasets, suggest measures for their enhancement, and propose future
research directions. We emphasize the need for standardized, comprehensive,
and ethically sound datasets that reflect the evolving threat landscape.
Future research should focus on data augmentation to cover a broader spectrum
of attack scenarios, improving the robustness of IDS against diverse threats.
Additionally, fostering open-source datasets and cross-sector collaboration
is crucial for integrating practical, real-world cybersecurity challenges
into academic research, thereby democratizing access and promoting innovation
in IDS development.
