The Secure Named Data Sharing (SNDS) project, funded by the NGI
Sargasso EU project, is building extensions to the Named-Data
Networking (NDN) ICN architecture, to implement query-based content
retrieval and fine-grained content storage and update operations. SNDS
will provide decentralized content integrity and authenticity
protections by leveraging Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable
Credentials and BBS+ digital signatures, a digital signature scheme
that enables selective disclosure of data by supporting Zero-Knowledge
Proofs. SNDS will allow large collections of content (for example, IoT
sensor readings) to be queried using the NGSI-LD API, which supports
queries based on content type and/or attribute values, translating
them into NDN operations. Case studies for SNDS include Vehicular
networks and Smart buildings.
