[GRNET CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team)](https://cert.grnet.gr/en/home/) provides incident response and security services to both the National Infrastructures for Research and Technology (GRNET) and to all Greek academic and research institutions. To do so, it employs Open-source Software (OSS) and approaches proposed by the academic community. In this talk we will discuss how GRNET CERT uses OSS to provide early warnings and alerts to its members and relevant organizations regarding risks and incidents. Furthermore, we will discuss how the team utilizes program analysis methods to assist the security audits it performs.
