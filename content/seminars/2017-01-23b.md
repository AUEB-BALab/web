The Unix dgsh shell provides an expressive way to construct
sophisticated and efficient data processing pipelines using standard
Unix tools, as well as third-party and custom-built components. Dgsh
allows the specification of pipelines of non-uniform non-linear
operations. For example tee can feed three processes whose output can
then be collected by paste. The pipelines form a directed acyclic
process graph, which is typically executed by multiple processor cores,
thus increasing the task's processing throughput. We will see how to use
dgsh in practice through a number of general data processing and
domain-specific examples, and how to adapt tools for use with dgsh.
