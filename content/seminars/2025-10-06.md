title: Identifying Code Authorship through Static Analysis and Behavioral Biometrics
date: 2025-10-06
presenter: Marek Horváth,  Technical University of Košice, Slovakia
category: seminars
time: 17:30


Abstract:
The seminar will introduce a research direction focused on authorship attribution in software engineering, exploring how the combination of source code stylometry and behavioral biometrics can be used to distinguish individual programmers. The talk will summarize the current state of a doctoral project in this domain, including applied methods and early findings. It will also briefly present related research activities conducted at the Technical University of Košice, with a special emphasis on applications in programming education and academic integrity.
