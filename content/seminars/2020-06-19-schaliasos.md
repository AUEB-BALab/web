A challenging issue in analyzing C packages is that it is challenging to reproduce them. In this talk, we present how we can exploit sbuild for running static analysis tools that need to rebuild a package to analyze it. sbuild is a tool that automates the build process of Debian packages. Moreover, we will see how we can scrape the Ultimate Debian Database for selecting packages base on some criteria.
