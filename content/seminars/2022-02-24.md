title: Dependable Software Supply Chains

Modern software is typically based on hundreds or even thousands of
software components.
This practice has ballooned software development productivity,
and has allowed the creation of extremely sophisticated software systems.
However, software components, many of which rely on other components,
come at a cost.
They are part of an often brittle software supply chain
with varying and sometimes lacking quality controls.
This has led to phenomenal losses and disasters.
I will present a research agenda aiming to reduce the considerable risk
that modern software projects face
by systematizing its analysis,
by establishing responses through inter-disciplinary research, and
by proposing a validated method for increasing SSC dependability.
