GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs,
and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.  I'll talk a bit
about GraphQL in general, then a bit about the ideas behind GraphQL-Mesh,
and then talk about the future ideas like GraphQL and semantic web and
ideas like that for which there is a lot of room for exploration.

Uri is the founder of The Guild - A group of open source developers,
mostly focused around GraphQL.
He was part of the writers of the GraphQL Subscriptions spec.
The Guild works with companies around the world, helping them with their API technologies and improving the open source libraries while doing it.
