title: Type Checking for Reliable APIs

We propose to configure at compile time the checking associated with
Application Programming Interfaces’ methods that can receive possibly
malformed values (e.g. erroneous user inputs and problematic retrieved
records from databases) and thus cause application execution failures.
To achieve this, we design a type system for implementing a
pluggable checker on the Java’s compiler and find at compile time
insufficient checking bugs that can lead to application crashes
due to malformed inputs. Our goal is to wrap methods when
they receive external inputs so that the former generate checked
instead of unchecked exceptions. We believe that our approach
can improve Java developers’ productivity, by using exception
handling only when it is required, and ensure client applications’
stability. We want to evaluate our checker by using it to verify
the source code of Java projects from the Apache ecosystem.
Also, we want to analyze stack traces to validate the identified
failures by our checker.
