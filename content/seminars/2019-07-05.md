Abstract: 
Continuous integration and deployment are part of the daily process in an industrial environment to boost productivity, reduce bugs, and automate processes. However, if not utilized correctly, it can cost a significant amount of time to test and integrate code changes. In this presentation, we show the effort demanded before and after employing CI/CD practices. Additionally, we show the shortcomings of our first CI/CD pipeline and explain how we optimized it. Moreover, we demonstrate how we improved our development process by incorporating cutting-edge technologies and practices such as Bitrise, Cypress, Docker containers, and Google's Cloud Platform services.
