Android users face increasingly sophisticated threats, ranging from
malware and state-sponsored surveillance, to supply chain attacks and a
large attack surface, mostly consisting of proprietary components.
Androidâ€™s semantic gap, i.e. the disconnect between application
behaviors and kernel-level events (system calls), is a major limiting
factor towards developing approaches capable of detecting threats in
the wild. This talk will present recent research on overcoming this
limitation, introducing SysDroid, a simple and lightweight approach to
reconstruct Android behaviors from Linux kernel traces.

SysDroid builds on two key insights: (a) I/O events can be captured in
the kernel and attributed to applications by following IPC edges, and
(b) a mapping between I/O events and interesting high-level behaviors
can be established a priori by associating I/O events to high-level
Android Framework API calls. The approach is effective in capturing
application behaviors and can be used as the basis for further
analysis.
