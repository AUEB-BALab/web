Data anonymisation is not easy: the Internet, after all, was not
created for anonymous communications. One way to anonymize digital
data is through *re-encryption shuffles*, i.e., shuffles of
re-encrypted data. Re-encryption shuffles are not new, yet efficient
open source solutions are hard to come by. This presentation will give
the background of challenges faced in anonymisation and report
progress in the implementation of a new re-encryption shuffle that
uses modern cryptographic techniques.
