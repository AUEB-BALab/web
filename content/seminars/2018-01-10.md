Software nowadays is an amalgamation of numerous components;
typical numbers show that every software product is
mostly comprised of re-usable code like libraries,
with only up to 20% of the code being specific to the product.
Keeping track of all these components and their metadata,
such as origin and licenses, is a significant problem that
has to be solved by each and every software producer.
The talk will discuss the need to keep accurate information
on the components and present the attempts to solve the issue
that are currently being designed and tried out in the industry.
Questions and discussion are welcome and greatly appreciated!
