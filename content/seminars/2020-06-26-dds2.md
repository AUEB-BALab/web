We present a dataset of open source software developed mainly by
enterprises rather than volunteers.  This can be used to address known
generalizability concerns, and, also, to perform research on open
source business software development.  Based on the premise that an
enterprise's employees are likely to contribute to a project developed
by their organization using the email account provided by it, we mine
domain names associated with enterprises from open data sources as
well as through white- and blacklisting, and use them through three
heuristics to identify 17,264 enterprise GitHub projects.  We provide
these as a dataset detailing their provenance and properties.  A manual
evaluation of a dataset sample shows an identification accuracy of 89%.
Through an exploratory data analysis we found that projects are staffed
by a plurality of enterprise insiders, who appear to be pulling more
than their weight, and that in a small percentage of relatively large
projects development happens exclusively through enterprise insiders.
