Recent research provides evidence that effective communication in collaborative 
software development has significant impact on  the software development lifecycle.  
Although related qualitative and quantitative studies point out textual 
characteristics of well-formed messages, the underlying semantics of the 
intertwined linguistic structures still remain largely misinterpreted or ignored. 
Especially, regarding quality of code reviews the importance of thorough feedback, 
and explicit rationale is often mentioned but rarely linked with related linguistic 
features. 
As a first step towards addressing this shortcoming, we propose grounding 
these studies on theories of linguistics. 
We particularly focus on linguistic structures of coherent speech and explain how 
they can be exploited in practice. 
We reflect on related approaches and examine through a preliminary study on four 
open source projects, possible links between existing findings and the directions 
we suggest for detecting textual features of useful code reviews.
