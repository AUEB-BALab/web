Poor design quality and huge technical debt are common issues perceived
in real-life software projects. Design smells are indicators of poor
design quality and the volume of design smells found could be treated as
the design debt of the software system. The existing smell detection
tools focus largely on implementation smells and do not reveal a
comprehensive set of smells that arise at design level. In this talk, I
present Designite - a software design quality assessment tool. It
supports comprehensive design smells detection and provides a detailed
metrics analysis. Further, it offers various features to help identify
issues contributing to design debt and improve the design quality of the
analyzed software system.

Tushar will present a corresponding paper at BRIDGE: First International
Workshop on Bringing Architecture Design Thinking into Developers' Daily
Activities (Bridge'16), which is co-located with the 38th International
Conference on Software Engineering, May 14 - 22, 2016.
