Understanding the evolving patterns of developer coding activity within the programming industry can help promote both individual well-being and organizational productivity.  We examine the evolution of commit activity among developers over the past decade through an analysis of commit data from 4\,549 GitHub repositories.  Our findings show a subtle but consistent increase in the proportion of nighttime and weekend commits, particularly during early morning hours, indicating a shift toward more flexible and asynchronous work habits.  In contrast, commit patterns across weekdays have remained stable, with no statistically significant differences between individual workdays from 2015 to 2024.  These trends suggest a gradual departure from the conventional 9-to-5, Monday-to-Friday structure, with developers increasingly distributing their work across broader time frames.  Our findings have practical implications for developers, who can use them to advocate for flexible work policies; for managers, who can better align schedules with real-world behaviors; and for researchers, who can further explore how temporal work patterns influence productivity and well-being.
