The research and academic environment in the United States 
is a topic of great interest to students and researchers worldwide. 
In this presentation, 
as an exchange student who recently returned from a program at Brown University,
I will share my experience and provide (I think valuable) insights 
regarding the research environment, 
life in the US, 
and significant lessons I learned during this period.

The presentation will begin with an introduction, 
covering the basic details of the program. 
Details about the US research environment, 
student life, 
challenges faced, 
and lessons learned will be then discussed.
Finally, a brief reference will be made to the recently-accepted paper at HotOS '23
"Executing Shell Scripts in the Wrong Order, Correctly", which will be presented in June.
