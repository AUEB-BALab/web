Epidose is an open source software reference implementation for an epidemic dosimeter. Just as a radiation dosimeter measures dose uptake of external ionizing radiation, the epidemic dosimeter tracks potential exposure to viruses or bacteria associated with an epidemic. The dosimeter measures a person's exposure to an epidemic, such as COVID-19, based on exposure to contacts that have been tested positive. The epidemic dosimeter is designed to be widely accessible and to safeguard privacy. Specifically, it is designed to run on the $10 open-hardware Raspberry Pi Zero-W computer, with a minimal user interface, comprising LED indicators regarding operation and exposure risk and a physical interlock switch to allow the release of contact data. The software is based on the DP3T contact tracing "unlinkable" design and corresponding reference implementation code.
