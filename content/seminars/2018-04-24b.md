title: Word Embeddings for the Software Engineering Domain  presenter: Vasiliki Efstathiou date: 2018-04-24 category: seminars

The software development process produces vast amounts of textual
data expressed in natural language. Outcomes from the natural
language processing community have been adapted in software
engineering research for leveraging this rich textual information;
these include methods and readily available tools, often furnished
with pre–trained models. State of the art pre–trained models however,
capture general, common sense knowledge, with limited value
when it comes to handling data specific to a specialized domain.
There is currently a lack of domain-specific pre–trained models that
would further enhance the processing of natural language artefacts
related to software engineering. To this end, we release a word2vec
model trained over 15GB of textual data from Stack Overflow posts.
We illustrate how the model disambiguates polysemous words by
interpreting them within their software engineering context. In
addition, we present examples of fine-grained semantics captured
by the model, that imply transferability of these results to diverse,
targeted information retrieval tasks in software engineering and
motivate for further reuse of the model.
