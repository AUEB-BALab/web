JavaScript is one of the most important elements of the web. It is
being used by the majority of websites and it is supported by all
modern browsers. We present the rst large-scale study of client- side
JavaScript code evolution. Speci cally, we have been collecting and
storing JavaScript code from Alexa’s top 10000 websites on a daily
basis (∼7.5 gb per day), for nine consecutive months. We have analyzed
the resulting dataset to study how often developers deploy new scripts
on the server-side. Our results indicate that the lifespan of scripts
is quite short. That is, ve days for external scripts and one day for
internal JavaScript code. In addition, we have examined how common
JavaScript code reuse and especially the reliance to third-party
libraries. Furthermore, we observed how software bugs evolve over
time. To do so, we employed well-known static analysis tools to
identify potential software bugs on the various scripts and then
observed if they increase or decrease over time.
