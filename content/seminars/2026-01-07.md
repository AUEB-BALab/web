title: Building Trustworthy Multimodal AI: From Representations to Responsible Deployment
presenter: Dimitrios Kollias, Queen Mary University of London
date: 2026-01-07
time: 13:15
category: seminars

The seminar will outline a research agenda for robust and trustworthy multimodal AI, centered on advances in representation learning, multi-objective optimization, causality and fairness under distribution shift. We argue that progress in multimodal learning requires moving beyond empirical performance toward models that explicitly account for structure, dependencies and invariances across modalities and tasks. I will discuss unifying principles for learning aligned and interpretable representations, handling conflicting objectives and partial supervision, and managing trade-offs between utility, robustness and fairness, with particular emphasis on the interplay between domain generalization and algorithmic fairness. These ideas are empirically validated in the context of behavior understanding and analysis, affective computing and digital humans, illustrating how principled multimodal learning can enable reliable and deployable intelligent systems.
