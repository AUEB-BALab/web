Finding and fixing errors in computing systems is an important and
difficult task. Often debugging consumes most of the time in a
developerâ€™s workday; obtaining the required experience can take a
lifetime. The talk categorizes, explains, and illustrates methods,
strategies, techniques, and tools that can be used to pinpoint elusive
and pestering bugs. The talk's aim is to provide an overview of the
complete debugging landscape: from general principles, high level
strategies, and behavioral traits to concrete techniques, handy tools,
and nifty tricks.
