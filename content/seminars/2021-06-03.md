Abstract: A Data Virtual Machine (DVM) is a novel graph-based conceptual
model, similar to the entity-relationship model, representing existing
data (persistent, transient, derived) of an organization. A DVM
can be built quickly, agilely, offering schematic flexibility to data
engineers. Data scientists can visually define complex dataframe
queries in an intuitive and simple manner, which are evaluated
within an algebraic framework. A DVM can be easily materialized
in any logical data model and can be “reoriented” around any node,
offering a “single view of any entity”. In this paper we demonstrate
DataMingler, a tool implementing DVMs . We argue that DVMs
can have a significant practical impact in analytics environments.
