There are many tools that perform static analysis on sourcecode
and extract information about the existence of code smells.
I would like to present our project which is in progress and 
focuses on Java source code. The main topics will include:
a summary of metrics and code smells that our project is able 
to extract, which are the main logical functionalities 
performed during execution and what goals this project tries to 
achieve.
