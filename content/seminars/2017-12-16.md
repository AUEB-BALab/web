Mining software repositories and search based software
engineering typically benefit from tools aiding text processing,
interaction data collection, evolutionary computation, testing, code
analysis, and repository analysis.  The corresponding data come from
data collections, source and binary code repositories, fault and failure
datasets, and process details.  Key issues in research in this area
concern the following of best practices and reproducibility.  We will
also see key readings and challenges for the future.

This is work jointly performed with Tse-Hsun (Peter) Chen, Yasutaka
Kamei, Masanari Kondo, Neil Walkinshaw, Xin Xia, and Shin Yoo based on
an NII Shonan Meeting working group formed to examine this topic.
