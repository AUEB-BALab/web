The SecOPERA project (Secure Open-source softwarE and hardwaRe
Adaptable framework), which was recently accepted for funding by the
EU, aims at improving the security of Open Source solutions. It will
use a number of different approaches, contributed by the different
partners, in order to provide a functional toolbox for security
assessment.

In this presentation we will describe what the project is about, its
objectives, and the role of AUEB (and our lab) in the consortium, as
well as the contribution by the University of Athens, which will be
led by Dimitris Mitropoulos who is now a Assistant Professor at the
Department of Business Administration.
