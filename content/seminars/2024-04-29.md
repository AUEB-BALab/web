We introduce a new approach to integrating Unix command-line tools with
visual programming, aiming to enhance accessibility and usability in data
processing pipelines. Leveraging Blockly, a visual programming language,
Unix commands are represented as graphical blocks, removing the need for
advanced programming skills and making them more accessible to a broader
audience. The creation of a visual programming environment enables users
to construct data processing pipelines through drag-and-drop actions,
facilitated by JSON definition files that create Unix command line
tool abstractions linking visual blocks to Unix commands. The design
is user friendly and deepens users' comprehension of Unix commands,
improving accessibility for difficult data manipulation tasks. The
project highlights the importance of visual programming in bridging
the gap between complex command-line operations and user-friendly
interfaces, thereby expanding the toolkit available for data scientists
and researchers of various fields, while also offering new opportunities
for interactive educational tools in command-line interface learning.
