Pawk is an extension to GoAwk, having been designed with efficiency in mind. It manages to achieve considerably higher performance to both the standard use Awk as well as GoAwk. The two reasons behind the significant speed boost offered by Pawk are the use of multi-threading programming, as well as the choice of Golang as the language of implementation. Since Pawk makes use of parallel programming, it is logical to be restricted only to operations that can be executed in parallel. However, we believe that Pawk can come handy in a plethora of cases, especially when dealing with multi-GB files.
