Programming language implementations can be viewed
as complex software systems. In this talk, we explore how core
object-oriented (OO) principles, especially polymorphism, help us build
modular, extensible, and maintainable representations of programs.
Using a small example language, we examine traditional approaches such
as the "Visitor" design pattern and contrast them with modern
Java features: records, sealed types, and pattern matching.
We show how these mechanisms allow us to express diverse operations on
program representations (evaluation, semantic analysis, etc.) elegantly
and declaratively, while avoiding boilerplate and ensuring runtime safety
through exhaustiveness checks.
