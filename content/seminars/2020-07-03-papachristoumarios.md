title:  Stochastic Opinion Dynamics for User Interest Prediction in Online Social Networks

category: seminars

In this seminar, we are going to talk about how one can infer the interests (e.g. hobbies)
of users in online social networks using information from highly influential users of the
network. More specifically, we experimentally observe that the majority of the network users
(>70%) is dominated by a sublinear fraction of highly-influential nodes (core nodes). 
This structural property of networks is also known as the "core-periphery" structure,
a phenomenon long-studied in economics and sociology.

Using the influencers' initial opinions as steady-state trend-setters, we develop a generative
model through which we explain how the users' interests (opinions) evolve over time, 
where each peripheral user looks at her k-nearest neighbors. Our model has strong theoretical 
and experimental guarantees and is able to surpass node embedding methods and related opinion 
dynamics methods and is able to scale to networks with millions of nodes. 

Duration: 30-40min.

Joint work with D. Fotakis (NTUA).
