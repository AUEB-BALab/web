The growing availability of open software repositories has advanced
research on mining software engineering data. Besides code-specic data,
an interest towards developer communication data has emerged aiming to
uncover features that impact on the software development lifecycle. Code
reviews in particular, provide rich textual communicative information
directly coupled with edits in source code. This talk will discuss
possible unexplored directions towards analyzing natural language in
code review comments, by adapting simple ideas from the community of
linguistics. The proposed research aims to identify natural language
patterns that imply higher level semantics, related to the underlying
reasoning and intentions (such as necessity and probability), of the
message conveyed in the comment.  The ultimate goal in this context, is
to uncover associations between the high-level semantics of comments and
the revisions they suggest, and potential effects in comment usefulness.
