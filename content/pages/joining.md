  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>We are always looking for brilliant people to join our growing group.
    New Business Analytics Lab Members can join as researchers, PhD candidates, research Associates, or research assistants.</p>
    <p>Business Analytics Lab <b>researchers</b> are typically academic Members of the Athens University of Economics and Business or post-doctoral researchers
    working within the Lab.</p>
    </br>
   <p><b>PhD candidates</b> joining the lab must be enrolled and active in an academic PhD programme. Twice a year the Department of Management
    Science and Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business issues a call for new PhD candidates.
    PhD candidates have a graduate and postgraduate degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, or equivalent qualifications.
    They have the opportunity to manage and work on a number of cutting edge research initiatives.</p>
    </br>
    <p><b>Research Associates</b> have a degree (or are in their final year of study) in Computer Science, Information Systems, or an equivalent
    programme. They can participate in our research activities with a chance to influence the future of Information Systems Technology.</p>
    </br>
    <p>We have also a limited number of open positions for research assistants: exceptional undergraduate students who wish to gain
    meaningful research experience or external affiliates providing consulting or administrative support to the Lab's activities.</p>
