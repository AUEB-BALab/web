phd_title: Energy and Run-Time Performance Practices in Software Engineering

phd_summary: Energy efficiency for computer systems is an ever-growing matter that has caught the attention of the software engineering community. Although hardware design and utilization are undoubtedly key factors affecting energy consumption, there is solid evidence that software design can also significantly alter the energy consumption of IT products. In this thesis, we investigate the energy and run-time performance implications of various programming languages and remote Inter-Process Communication technologies in order to suggest which to use for specific cases. Moreover, through our investigation, we find that security mechanisms can affect real-world applications (i.e., Apache, Nginx, Redis, Memcached) energy and run-time performance up to 20%.

_Stefanos Georgiou_ is a PhD candidate at Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).
Currently, he is pursuing his PhD, which is part of the Software ENgineering in Enterprise Cloud Applications
project ([SENECA](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/642954)), a Marie-Curie European Industrial Doctorate funded  program.
For his PhD studies, he is supervised by [Prof. Diomidis Spinellis](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/) from AUEB,
and together they have performed several empirical research studies to identify software engineering practices
and techniques to reduce softwareâ€™s energy consumption.   
Stefanos also holds a BSc in Networks and Systems Programming from the University of Cyprus
and an MSc in PERvasive Computing and COMmunications for sustainable development ([PERCCOM](http://perccom.univ-lorraine.fr/)),
a joint Master Degree from four different Universities.
