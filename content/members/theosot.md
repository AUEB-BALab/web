_Thodoris Sotiropoulos_ is a PhD student at the Athens University of Economics and Business
working in the areas of programming languages, program analysis, and testing under the
supervision of Prof Diomidis Spinellis. His research focuses on the design of appropriate
abstractions that help examine the reliability of complex software, such as compilers
data-oriented systems, or software that heavily relies on the file system. Thodoris holds an
MSc with distinction in Advanced Computing from Imperial College London and he has previously
worked as a software engineer at the Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET). Recently,
he was an applied scientist intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS) where he worked on the design
and implementation of static analysis techniques for detecting security issues.

His main research interests include programming languages,
software testing,
and compilers.
