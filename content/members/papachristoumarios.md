I am a Senior Undergraduate Student at National Technical University of Athens. I am currently doing my undergraduate thesis on Machine Learning under the supervision of Prof. Dimitris Fotakis.

I am also a researcher at Business Analytics Lab (BALab), supervised by Prof. Diomidis Spinellis.

My research interests include Machine Learning (specializing in Graphs), Software Engineering and Algorithms.
