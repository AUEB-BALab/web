Damianos Chatziantoniou received his B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of
Athens (June 1991, summa cum laude) and continued his studies in Computer Science at
Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University (M.Sc., Dec. 1992) and
Columbia University (M.Phil., Feb. 1996, Ph.D., June 1997). His academic research interests
include big data, business intelligence (data warehousing, OLAP), large-scale analytics
(MapReduce and beyond), query processing, data streams and real-time analysis. He has
published more than 30 articles at top conferences and journals, such as VLDB, ICDE, EDBT,
KDD, SIGMOD, Journal of Information Systems, Journal of Data and Knowledge Engineering and
elsewhere. His research work has influenced Microsoft’s SQL Server (query processor),
Oracle’s 8i and 9i Systems (Analytic Functions for OLAP, a benchmark for any BI system), and
ANSI SQL Standard (OLAP Amendment). There are more than 11 U.S. patents using Damianos’ research
work as primary reference (among these, 4 from Microsoft, 2 from IBM and 2 from Oracle) and
more than 150 citations to his work, including 9 data management textbooks.  He is currently
