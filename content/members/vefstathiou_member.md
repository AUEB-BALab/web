phd_summary: Computational logic-based argumentation involves reasoning with uncertainty by making use of logic in order to formalize the presentation of arguments and counter-arguments and deal with conflicting information.  The expressivity of classical propositional logic allows for intricate knowledge to be represented but its computational cost is an issue. This thesis provides a solution to this problem by adapting techniques  based on foundations of logic programming and connection graphs for automated theorem proving.

Vasiliki Efstathiou holds a PhD in Computer Science from University College London, an MSc in Computer Science from the same University and a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Crete. Her PhD thesis investigated automated theorem proving techniques for implementing computational argumentation based on classical logic. Her research interests lie in the wider area of knowledge representation and reasoning.
