MyGROCER is a research project
partially funded by the European Commission (IST Programme). The project
spanned over two years (from January 2001 to November 2002) and exploited the
potential of wireless technologies (namely Wireless LANs) and automatic product
identification techniques (Radio Frequency identification, RF-id) to develop
an innovative business and technological solution for the retail environment. <br/><br/>

In effect, MyGROCER implemented
and field-tested a new and integrated shopping scheme
that supports the shopper throughout his/her entire supermarket visit by means
of a prototype shopping cart capable to automatically scan supermarket products
while at the same time provide valuable information to the shopper through a display
device thus, create a fully interactive shopping trip. The use of the system by
supermarket shoppers revealed that the new shopping scheme can provide a more
entertaining and efficient shopping trip compared to the conventional way of
shopping, and thus generate new shopping experiences. <br/><br/>
