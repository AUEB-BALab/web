People increasingly depend on their personal smart devices (smartphones, smart watches, voice assistants) to communicate,
access information, transact, and perform critical functions. These devices overwhelmingly comprise proprietary software
and hardware components made by a handful of non-EU vendors. These vendors have exceptional control over those devices,
raising justified concerns over anti-competitive practices, massive data gathering, surveillance, denial of service, and
consequently personal freedoms and democracy. Digital sovereignty has been identified as a key political priority for the
EU. SPUCS: “software architectures for Secure, Private, and User-Controlled Smart devices” contributes novel
privacy-preserving architectures, realizable on existing hardware, that limit the control of vendors on user devices towards
a future of open, sovereign personal devices.
