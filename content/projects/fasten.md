The FASTEN project partners are developing an intelligent software package management systems that will enhance robustness and security in software ecosystems. The research and development activities include innovative ecosystem analysis techniques, with C, Java and Python applications. Derived techniques will tackle the problems of security and risk evaluation, license compliance and change impact analysis. Moreover, a back-end service and a knowledge base will host the results of those analyses while the integration of those analyses will reach the developerâ€™s workflow and Continuous Integration (CI) tool chains.
