The aim of the project is the interconnection of commercial applications
and the conduct of inter-business transactions through the internet,
based on open standards. The resulting system will allow companies to
carry out business transactions through the internet in an ad-hoc
manner, minimizing the paperwork required. The system design will
utilize know-how and standards based on the Extensible Markup Language
(XML), such as ebXML, allows the effective design of e-business
applications based on data interchange.
