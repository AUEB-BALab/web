The <em>Web site</em> project aims to create a dynamic,
distributed, and maintanable Web site for ISTLab.
<br/>
Traditionally, the realization of Web sites involves either
static content developed using web authoring tools like
Microsoft's Front Page and DreamWeaver, or dynamic
content delivered by a database driven front-end,
where the structured content is organized
in a relational schema and dynamically generated on the fly.
When our group faced the successive failure of both the above approaches,
we decided to adopt the task of exploring ideas for a radically different
implementation style, based on the declarative specification
of all the site's elements.
We believe that our approach and many of the lessons we learned
can be applied numerous similar situations,
leading to a lightweight, structured, consistent, and maintainable
web site building method.
<br/>
The guiding principles behind our design are:
<ul>
<li>Openness</li>
<li>Observability</li>
<li>Robustness</li>
<li>Parsimony</li>
</ul>
