The S-OMA Smart Cards project aims to exploit the technological
opportunities arising from recent evolutions in the areas of secure
smart cards. Moreover, the S-OMA SMART CARDS project will identify and
propose best practices and methodologies regarding the design and
testing of secure tamper-resistant multipurpose smart cards. Significant
effort will be put towards the best utilization of the available
resources and the enhancement of portability between different smart
card technologies.
