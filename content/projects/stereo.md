The project aims to provide an infrastructure that will facilitate research efforts by integrating
data collection, data processing in large-scale infrastructures, and dissemination of results.
In order to evaluate software quality,
data from Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects will be used.
Such an infrastructure will consist of:
1) Software, enabling researchers to develop and run experiments efficiently on large data volumes,
along with a collection of readily available data processing, curating and analysis methods
2) Pre-processed data, from FLOSS projects, in a form that is suitable for analysis
3) A cloud based computation infrastructure, suitable for mass data processing.
