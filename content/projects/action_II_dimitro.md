Code injection attacks are considered as one of the most damaging classes of application attacks that can harm various entities existing either on a web server, a client machine or a mobile device. With the proposed research we will aim to synthesize empirical findings coming of the analysis of the evolution and the behavior of software bugs that lead to code injection attacks, with existing pieces of theoretical work into an approach that covers all types of code injection attacks. Then, we will try to apply out approach to tame such attacks in different problem domains (web, mobile, etc.). For every application of our method, we will provide corresponding prototypes, deploy them in real world conditions and test them in terms of accuracy, operation cost and maintenance cost.
