On-line business transaction processing systems have so far been based on centralized or client-server architectures. It is our firm belief and
it has also been recognized by the research and industrial communityâ€“that such systems may also be based on the constantly evolving decentralized
peer-to-peer architectures, as current peer-to-peer technology has evolved to the extent that it is able to fulfill many of these requirements
to a large extent. The aim of the project is the research and design of eBusiness transaction processing systems based on entirely decentralised
 peer-to-peer architectures, based on a detailed requirements definition and analysis. The proposed design will cover issues such as support
for discovery of services, merchandise or trading parties; authentication and access control, and negotiating collaboration parameters;
support for workflow and collaboration orchestration, logging and non-repudiation; user ranking and reputation management; various other
generic non-functional requirements including security, availability and anonymity.
