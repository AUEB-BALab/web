 <p>
  	ISTLab/SENSE Members participate actively in E-Business Forum. In particular, working group IA4 focused its attention in the area of "Preliminary Actions for the Establishment of the Greek Computer Emergency Response Team (GR-CERT)".

    GR-CERT is an initiative, which aims to provide timely notifications regarding software vulnerabilities, malware epidemics and fraud schemes.

  	The IA4 working group focuses on non experts and SMEs not employing technical personnel  and therefore all the necessary information is provided in a simple and understandable manner for the average user.  

	Results will be published in the form of reports and will be presented in a workshop.
