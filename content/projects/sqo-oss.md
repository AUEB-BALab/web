What do we know about the quality of the software you are using?  A well-known conjecture 
in software engineering is that external quality characteristics are correlated to internal quality 
characteristics and thus the measurement of source code provides useful data for the 
assessment of its quality. Uniquely, open source software allows us to examine the actual 
code and perform white box testing and analysis of it. In most open source projects we can 
also access their version control system, mailing lists and issue databases.  We can use these 
data sources to extract quality indicators through techniques, such as data mining. 
SQO-OSS aims to increase the competitiveness of European software development SMEs 
through a holistic approach of software quality assessment, initially targeting open source 
software. The project seeks to use as many sources of quality indicators as possible so as to 
create a set of metrics that can be applied automatically to a software project’s repository in 
order to extract quantifiable measurements of its quality.  The project will deliver:


A plug-in based quality assessment platform, featuring a web and an idE front-end.
An enhanced set of software metrics that will take into account quality indicators from data that is present in a project’s repository, but not yet used for quality assessment.
A publicly available league of open source software applications, categorised by their quality characteristics.
A methodology that will allow European SMEs to leverage the availability of quality-assessed open source software in the development of horizontal and vertical applications and the provision of value-added services.
Experience reports of how the tool’s application affected a large open source project


The project leverages existing tools and will also create new ones in an effort to build an
integrated quality assessment platform. The core will be released as open source software 
under the BSD licence to stimulate business interest around it.
