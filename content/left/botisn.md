At March 2016, Nikiforos participated in the InnoJam++ @CeBIT 2016 co-organized by SAP and Volkswagen in Hanover, a 32-hour hands-on experience in the latest technologies that are utilized by SAP, following his excellence at the SAP ERP labs which took place in the university (scoring at the 2.5% of the class).
