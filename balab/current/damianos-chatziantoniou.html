Damianos Chatziantoniou received his B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of
Athens (June 1991, summa cum laude) and continued his studies in Computer Science at
Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University (M.Sc., Dec. 1992) and
Columbia University (M.Phil., Feb. 1996, Ph.D., June 1997). His academic research interests
include big data, business intelligence (data warehousing, OLAP), large-scale analytics
(MapReduce and beyond), query processing, data streams and real-time analysis. He has
published more than 30 articles at top conferences and journals, such as VLDB, ICDE, EDBT,
KDD, SIGMOD, Journal of Information Systems, Journal of Data and Knowledge Engineering and
elsewhere. His research work has influenced Microsoft’s SQL Server (query processor),
Oracle’s 8i and 9i Systems (Analytic Functions for OLAP, a benchmark for any BI system), and
ANSI SQL Standard (OLAP Amendment). There are more than 11 U.S. patents using Damianos’ research
work as primary reference (among these, 4 from Microsoft, 2 from IBM and 2 from Oracle) and
more than 150 citations to his work, including 9 data management textbooks.  He is currently
an Assistant Professor at Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB), Department of
Management Science and Technology. Prior to AUEB, he has served as a tenure-track Assistant
Professor at Stevens Institute of Technology (September 1997-December 1999.)

Besides academia, Damianos has been involved in several technology startups. Panakea Software
Inc. (founder, 1998), based in New York City, developed and marketed database querying/reporting
technology to make certain analytic tasks (OLAP) easier to express and faster to evaluate. Clients
included Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and Philips North America.
VoiceWeb SA (founder, 2001), based in Athens, focused on speech and telecom applications. VoiceWeb is
currently the leading company in the Balkans in speech-related applications. In 2011, Bank of Piraeus
acquired a stake at Voiceweb. Clients include Vodafone, Wind, Alpha Bank, Village Cinemas, Athens
Festival, etc. Damianos has served in 2007-2008 as a senior research consultant in Aster Data
Systems, a high-profile database technology startup based on Silicon Valley, dealing with distributed data
warehouses. Aster Data was acquired in March of 2011 by Teradata.
