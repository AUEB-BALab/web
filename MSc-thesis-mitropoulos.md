Title: Employing Different Program Analysis
	Methods to Study the Evolution of Bugs in OS Libraries

Abstract:
The purpose of this work is to detect
software bugs in different versions of two well-known
sets of Unix libraries
(GNU Binary Utilities and GNU Core Utilities),
and examine how these bugs evolve over time.
To do so,
we use three tools that are based on
different approaches,
namely: static analysis,
symbolic execution,
and fuzzing.
In this way we can also comment on
the different outputs of the tools
and examine their effectiveness.
We present all bugs that the tools detected,
their evolution over time,
what kind of bugs each tool found,
and perform a qualitative analysis on the results.
Our results indicate that we cannot say
if bugs either decrease or increase over time.
Finally,
we see that each tool detects different
types of bugs.
