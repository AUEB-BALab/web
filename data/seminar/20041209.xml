		  <pres_summary>On-line business transaction processing systems have so far been based on centralized or client-server architectures. It is our firm belief - and it has also been recognized by the research and industrial community - that such systems may also be based on the constantly evolving decentralized peer-to-peer architectures. The first step in this direction, which constitutes the core of our paper, is a detailed requirements definition and analysis. We discuss requirements preceding the actual collaborations, such as support for discovery of services, merchandise or trading parties, authentication and access control, and negotiating collaboration parameters; requirements referring to the actual collaboration and transaction phases, such as support for workflow and collaboration orchestration, logging and non-repudiation; requirements following the collaboration, such as user ranking and reputation management; and generic non-functional requirements including security, availability and anonymity. We conclude that current peer-to-peer technology has evolved to the extent that it is able to fulfill many of these requirements to a large extent.</pres_summary>
