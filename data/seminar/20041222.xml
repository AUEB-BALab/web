Up-to-date data comes at a cost, albeit an economic one that is often
ignored in the computer science literature. This oversight is indeed
inconsequential when it comes to transaction or high-availability
systems such as banking or airline where the cost of error due to less
than up-to-data  is very high.
<p />
In On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) Systems, where data is
extensively aggregated and mathematically manipulated in order to
support high-level reporting and ad-hoc analysis, accounting-like data
accuracy may not be important. Besides, keeping an OLAP system
up-to-date usually involves a substantial amount of recomputation than
can be both costly and lead to down-time.
<p />
In the context of a pharmaceutical marketing research database and OLAP
system, we treat data as a vector evolving in time and seek to minimize
overall system usage and maintenance cost. This talk will present a set
of stochastic Poisson arrival and Brownian motion models and introduce
relevant policies that determine how far out-of-date data should allowed
to go before an update is imperative.
