		<phd-title>The adoption of collaborative technologies in project based teams: Investigating the role of collaboration intensity in individuals' perceptions and beliefs</phd-title>
		<phd-summary>
		<p>
		 The research interest is focusing on studying the social and organisational dynamics which underlie recent technological and work developments in networked organisations. In the effort of investigating factors affecting the intention to adopt collaborative technologies in project based organizations for improving project management and coordination it is interesting to study: 'How best to develop a research framework that organizes and guides research efforts as well as offering insights to management practice. This effort is based on investigating the influence of collaboration intensity of team members on their attitudes and beliefs regarding the adoption of collaborative technologies in project work'. Further, the research challenge is to study the social and organisational dynamics which underlie recent technological and work developments in project based organizational settings. Finally, the empirical data of my study are extracted from both qualitative (case study) and quantitative methods (survey analysis) by applying structural equation modelling techniques.
