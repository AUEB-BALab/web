		</phd-title>
		<phd-summary>
		<p>
		e-Learning attracts considerable interest in contemporary corporate training curricula. As it usually concerns a significant investment, organizations that tend to adopt and maintain it effectively and efficiently in the long term, need to learn from the pioneers. Literature and practical experience indicate critical success factors and frameworks for adoption in both organizational and individual levels. This study tries to examine thoroughly the acceptance of e-Learning from employees - learners.
