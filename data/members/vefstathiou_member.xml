      <phd-summary>Computational logic-based argumentation involves reasoning with uncertainty by making use of logic in order to formalize the presentation of arguments and counter-arguments and deal with conflicting information. 
The expressivity of classical propositional logic allows for intricate knowledge to be represented but its computational cost is an issue. This thesis provides a solution to this problem by adapting techniques 
based on foundations of logic programming and connection graphs for automated theorem proving.</phd-summary>
