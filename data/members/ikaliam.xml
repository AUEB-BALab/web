		<phd-title>The socio-technical aspect of communication and coordination in global software development: The open source software development environment</phd-title>
		<phd-summary>
Open Source Software (OSS) has received growing attention due to the diversified characteristics of its development linked also with its noticeable adoption and quality. One key element that enables OSS's dynamic evolution is the internal organization of dispersed developers into effective teams that produce the output of the process. This thesis investigates the collaboration between dispersed OSS developers and the level of fit between the technical structure of the software and the coordination processes that complement it.
