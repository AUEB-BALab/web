			<phd-title>Mobile Advertising Effectiveness</phd-title>
			<phd-summary>
				The present research belongs to the field of mobile advertising. 
				To date there is no established theory available as the case of traditional advertising. 
				Therefore, the principles of traditional and interactive advertising served as foundations for this study. 
				Given that little is known regarding the factors that may influence the effectiveness of a mobile advertising campaign the research design employed in this study includes: (a) literature review, (b) an exploratory field study, and (c) a screening experiment. 
				The outcome of this process was tested through a confirmatory field experiment with 800 participants.
