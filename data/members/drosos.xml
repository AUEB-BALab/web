		<phd-title>Measuring Mobile Advertising Effectiveness</phd-title>
		<phd-summary>
			Technological advances bring forth new and innovative advertising media, such as the Internet, interactive television, and, more recently, mobile messaging advertising. According to the Interactive Mobile Advertising Platform mobile advertising is defined as “the business of encouraging people to buy products and services using the wireless channel as medium to deliver the advertisement message”. Mobile advertising (m-advertising) enables not only sending unique, personalised, and customised ads, but also engaging consumers in dialogues and transactions with the brand. In view of the perennial effort to examine determinants of successful advertising campaigns through the bundle of advertising media, this PhD also attempts to conceptualize factors that influence the effects of a mobile messaging advertising campaign, referring especially to push advertising via Short Messaging Service (SMS) text.
