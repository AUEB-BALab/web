		<phd-title>Memory performance of object oriented languages</phd-title>
		<phd-summary>
			Modern object-oriented programming languages offer a wealth of features to the programmer, but those features come at a price. Today's programs are memory and processing power hungry, while not offering features that justify the high requirements. In our research, we investigate the memory usage characteristics of modern applications. We aim to construct a system where the programmer will only pay for the price he is asking for in terms of memory usage.
