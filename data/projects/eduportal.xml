Eduportal is a unified portal allowing access to academic information
and content regarding undergraduate and graduate course curricula.
<br/><br/>
It is opeational since March 2004, and currently hosts the DMST
undergraduate Degree courses, the International MBA Courses and the
Graduate Programme in Human Resources Management (MSc) Courses. It can
be seamlessly expanded to cover other courses, without the need for
software or hardware updates.
<br/><br/>
A powerful "back-office" allows the teaching staff to individually:
provide information about their courses, the teaching and laboratory
support stuff, contact information etc; structure their courses,
lectures and laboratories; upload material to be made available to the
students; post announcements; etc.
