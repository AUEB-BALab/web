	<description>
In urban freight movement a good, near-optimal, distribution plan is necessary but not 
sufficient for high performance distribution. This is mainly due to the probabilistic 
factors that urban movement depends on, such as high levels of traffic congestion, 
negative environmental impact, tight delivery time windows, vehicle breakdowns, unexpected 
events and so on.We propose a dynamic vehicle management system that monitors distribution
 vehicles in real-time and recommends intelligent re-routing interventions that minimize 
the adverse impact of unforeseen events on the entire system
