JavaScript is one of the most important elements of the web. It is being used by the majority of websites and it is supported by all modern browsers. On the other hand though, it can be a vector for many dangerous attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS). With the proposed research we will aim to examine the evolution of JavaScript code over time. Specifically, by using building blocks from our previous research thrusts we will create a framework that collects the scripts used by different websites on a daily basis. Then, we will analyze the resulting dataset to (a) observe if whitelisting defenses can be efficiently employed by websites, (b) examine the development pace of multiple web applications and (c) examine the evolution of potential bugs found in the JavaScript code.
