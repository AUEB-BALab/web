Code injection attacks are one of the most damaging class of attacks because: they can occur in different layers, like databases, native code, applications, libraries and others; and they span a wide range of security and privacy issues, like viewing sensitive information, destruction or modification of sensitive data, or even stopping the execution of the entire application. Our research attempts to prevent a wide class of such attacks in a novel way.
