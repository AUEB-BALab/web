	<description>
During the last years several worm epidemics have emerged as major threats to critical digital infrastructures.
To make large-scale networks more resilient against these kind of threats, we evaluate the usage of peer-to-peer architectures whereby each peer is responsible for
<ul>
<li>Detecting whether a virus or worm is uncontrollably propagating through the network resulting in an epidemic.</li>
<li>Automatically dispatching warnings and information to other peers of a security-focused group.</li>
<li>Taking specific precautions for their host by automatically hardening their security measures during the epidemic.</li>  
</ul>
