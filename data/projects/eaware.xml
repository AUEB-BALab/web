eAWARe aims to educate the everyday Internet user about online risks and the 
steps users can take to protect themselves. eAWARe reaches out to the public 
through local events across Europe. We will also produce a free guide on how to 

have and host your own event to promote information security awareness. eAWARe 
is supported by the Directorate General for Research of the European 
Commission. eAWARe will hold its final international conference during the 
first week of November 2003 in Rome, Italy. This event is part of the European 
Commission's initiatives in the context of European Science Week. eAWARe also 
supports the dissemination of the OECD Guidelines for Information and Network 
Security.
