CONTESSA will bring enormous benefits to the Content Industry by
allowing content to be automatically and cost effectively adapted
to any requesting device (PC, smart phones, mobile phones, PDAs, DTV
set-top-boxes, etc.) seamlessly over any network infrastructure. The
main objectives of CONTESSA are:
<ul>
<li>Develop a content transformation engine that will provide translation
and integration of content into device-tailored user interfaces through
alternative communication channels. The system will track and manage
alternative access devices while providing a personalized environment
for content deployment based on a standardized XML framework that will
allow the content to be extracted, converted and integrated, without
the creator's interference.</li>
<li>Validate the system through a number of interactive transactional
services to be delivered over multiple types of networks, to devices
using different access protocols enabling e-Commerce and e-Business
widespread application.</li>
</ul>
