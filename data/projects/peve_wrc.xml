	    The project aims at investigating factors affecting the process through which consumers develop (a)
 their initial intention to adopt Mobile Data Services  (MDS) and (b) their subsequent actual adoption behavior. 
The study will investigate the current use and future potential of MDS under a cross-national perspective, since 
it will be co-ordinated with the Worldwide Mobile Data Services Survey (WMDSS), which is a global self-funded 
academic survey being carried out annually since 2002 in more than ten countries across the globe . In particular, 
the scope of the study is twofold: i) to define an explanatory model of the individual, social, and application 
factors influencing an individual's intention to adopt MDS along with the conditions that facilitate or prohibit 
the subsequent actual MDS usage and ii) to designate the mobile market's future potential and how consumers can 
be classified in terms of intention and usage behavior. Both these objectives will be investigated via a cross-national 
approach, while this application seeks funding only for the national (Greek) part of it.
