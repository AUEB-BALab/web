On-line business transaction processing systems have so far been based on centralized or client-server architectures. It is our firm belief and 
it has also been recognized by the research and industrial community–that such systems may also be based on the constantly evolving decentralized 
peer-to-peer architectures, as current peer-to-peer technology has evolved to the extent that it is able to fulfill many of these requirements 
to a large extent. The aim of the project is the research and design of eBusiness transaction processing systems based on entirely decentralised
 peer-to-peer architectures, based on a detailed requirements definition and analysis. The proposed design will cover issues such as support 
for discovery of services, merchandise or trading parties; authentication and access control, and negotiating collaboration parameters; 
support for workflow and collaboration orchestration, logging and non-repudiation; user ranking and reputation management; various other 
generic non-functional requirements including security, availability and anonymity.
