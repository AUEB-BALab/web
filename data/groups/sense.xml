Software-intensive products and services permeate the fabric of modern
life.  The way we build software has profound implications on our society,
the environment, the economy, and our everyday lives.  Software artifacts
are today the most complex  systems we engineer.  The efficient and
correct construction of software is not an option, but an imperative.
The ISTLab - SENSE (Software Engineering and Security) group aims to
change the way software is developed, deployed, maintained, and used.
The research streams of the SENSE group include:

<ul>
			<li>Software development tools and techniques</li>
			<li>Quality and reusability of open source software</li>
			<li>Safety, security, and availability of software systems</li>
			<li>Peer to peer networks</li>
			<li>Domain-specific languages</li>
			<li>Stochastic optimisation algorithms and applications</li>
		</ul>

The objectives of the SENSE group are:
<ul>
			<li>Advance the state of the art in software development by realizing tools and methods for efficiently developing reliable, maintainable, and secure applications.</li>
			<li>Study the reusability of open source software focusing on the quality of the corresponding artefacts.</li>
			<li>Examine the safety, security and availability aspects of applications and develop processes, algorithms, and environments for conducting secure and resilient transactions.</li>
			<li>Develop algorithms and applications based on peer to peer networks.</li>
			<li>Explore the potential of domain-specific languages by designing focused, flexible, and efficient languages for expressing rules, models, processes, and applications.  These are used to bridge the gap between an information system’s specification and implementation. </li>
			<li>Study and apply stochastic optimisation algorithms, such as simulated annealing, taboo search, and genetic algorithms, applying them in the optimisation of eBusiness processes.</li>
			<li>Evaluate technology advances in new information technologies.</li>
		</ul>
